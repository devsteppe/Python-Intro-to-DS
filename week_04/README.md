### Practice & homework
The practice for this week takes place in notebooks. Just open them and follow instructions from there.
* __Seminar:__ `./seminar.ipynb`
* __Homework:__ `./homework.ipynb`
* __Lecture Slides__ [in Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xvFdwrbyv6bIf1Dz_IWUapFh_qPKhlRFyivZ6XHBnWo/edit?usp=sharing)

Unless explicitly said otherwise, all subsequent weeks follow the same pattern (notebook with instructions).

If you have any difficulties with notebooks, just open them in [Open In Jupyter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devsteppe/Python-Intro-to-DS/blob/master/week_04/seminar.ipynb).
