### Python Syntax and Data Types

### Practice & homework
The practice for this week takes place in notebooks. Just open them and follow instructions from there.
* __Seminar:__ `./seminar.ipynb`
* __Homework:__ `./homework.ipynb`

Unless explicitly said otherwise, all subsequent weeks follow the same pattern (notebook with instructions).

If you have any difficulties with notebooks, just open them in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/nlp_course/blob/master/week01_embeddings/seminar.ipynb).
