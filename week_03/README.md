### Functions

### Practice & homework
The practice for this week takes place in notebooks. Just open them and follow instructions from there.
* __Seminar:__ `./seminar.ipynb`
* __Homework:__ `./homework.ipynb`
* __Lecture Slides__ [in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QO07Pv-GtfIRYddBUfXp3qS5DUfV0sbCZb5PVNX0Rp8)

Unless explicitly said otherwise, all subsequent weeks follow the same pattern (notebook with instructions).

If you have any difficulties with notebooks, just open them in [Open In Jupyter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devsteppe/Python-Intro-to-DS/blob/master/week_03/seminar.ipynb).
